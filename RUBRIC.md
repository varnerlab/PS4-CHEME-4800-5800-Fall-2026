# PS4 grading rubric

PS4 is worth a maximum of **4 points**: Parts 1–2 and questions 1–3 in
[responses.md](responses.md). There are **48 tests**, 24 each in
[testme_part_1.jl](testme_part_1.jl) and [testme_part_2.jl](testme_part_2.jl).

| Score | Requirements |
|:---:|---|
| 0 | Nothing runs; no tests pass. |
| 1 | Some tests pass, but not a majority (1–24). |
| 2 | A majority of tests pass, but at least one fails (25–47). |
| 3 | All 48 tests pass, but questions 1–3 are not all satisfactorily answered. |
| 4 | All 48 tests pass and questions 1–3 are satisfactorily answered. |

Run `check_submission.jl` to see your test results and find unanswered
questions. Passing all the tests and the checker does not by itself earn a 4; the
instructor reads and grades your answers.

To grade, the instructor copies your `src/Compute.jl`, any helper files, and
`Include.jl` into a clean copy of the assignment, reruns the tests, and then
reads your `responses.md`.

The policies in [README.md](README.md) also apply: no initial submission, or
copying the reference solution, scores `0`.
